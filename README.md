**Detect image and convert to Gif use 2 Algorithm:**
> ORB(Oriented and Rotated BRIEF ): This algorithm can detect and describe features such as angles, points, edges, etc. simply and quickly.

> Brute-Force Matcher: The algorithm compares all pairs of features of the image with each other to find the best pair of features.

**Remove and change background use package in OpenCV:**
> cvzone: a computer vision engine that helps perform image processing functions such as face recognition, hand tracking, posture estimation, and other artificial intelligence functions.

> Self Segmentation: The Self Segmentation module in cvzone is used to remove the background of selfies taken. This process separates the photographer from the background and facilitates background substitution.

**My project has list background, you just need use keyboard to change other background**(*You can replace in my code*)
* '1': previous background
* '2': next background

## To use cvzone you need install:
`!pip install mediapipe 
!pip install cvzone`

## Ouput of project:

`Unzip background(list background) and imageandgif(contains of 2 files in my code)`_
